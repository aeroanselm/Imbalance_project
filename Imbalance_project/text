Firstly a thrust profile of both \textbf{EAPs} and \textbf{EPC} as near as possible to the real data has to be obtained. Secondly the propellant mass flow rate of the engines has to be computed in order to analyze in the next chapter the excursion of the centre of gravity due to the propellant consumption during the first stage burning time.\\

The aim of this report is to analyse the performances of an Ariane 5-ECA, in terms of thrust vector control (TVC) and thrust, in the boosting phase, while a thrust imbalance of the system is generated due to possible engine issues to both the solid boosters that leads to a power loss and a reduction of thrust with respect to expected values. \\
The thrust imbalance considered in this study can be explained as a disturbance moment generated by an off-design performance of the boosters. The resulting couple of the solid boosters’ thrusts tend to make the rocket turning. In design condition the moments generated by the boosters are perfectly balanced between themselves; in real application some disturbances may cause the generation of the imbalance effect even if boosters are working near to optimal performance condition. TVC is used to compensate the rotation and to follow the desired attitude during the launch. \\ 
The thrust imbalance, even if compensated by TVC, causes some issues to the rocket performances as will be explained later. Briefly, in the best case just a loss of total thrust is sensed due to the rotation of the thrust vectors by TVC, in the worst case it would cause the loss of trajectory control and the complete failure of the mission. As for the actually used engines for this launcher, TVC systems are effective both on main engine nozzle and boosters’ ones even if deflection angles are different.\\
The thrust losses are modelled as random variations of thrust levels that can be expressed statistically as a rectangular distribution. \\
The analysis will cover many important aspects regarding the launcher starting from a managerial study of the project through a House of Quality and project triangular scheme, then a presentation and evaluation of technical aspects of Ariane 5-ECA during interesting flight phases will follow. Propulsion, aerodynamics, mass distribution and TVC values during unbalanced flight will be shown together with a presentation of the launcher characteristic and dimensions through a CAD model made with SolidWorks\textsuperscript\textregistered.

\chapter{Introduction}
\chapter{Requirements and Specifications}
\section{Requirements}
The customer requirements [relative weight] are: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item Similar-to-target altitude and velocity at boosters’ detachment [30.3\%]: due to an imbalance in the thrust the preliminary target can be unreachable and an acceptable similar one should be reached
 \item Full control of trajectory [24.2\%]: during the whole flight, the rocket trajectory must be fully controllable
 \item High precision attitude control [21.2\%]: to manage the thrust imbalance an effective attitude control system is required
 \item Lightweight system [6.1\%]: a lightweight system is preferable due to many advantages
 \item Cheap system [6.1\%]
 \item Robustness to atmospheric disturbances [12.1\%]:  a minor effect of atmospheric disturbances (e.g. transversal winds) should help in focusing on the management of thrust imbalance
 \end{itemize}
\section{Specifications}
\subsection{Project management triangle}
As managerial approach the best decision results in focusing on performances (\textit{best performance approach}), with a minimum weak limitation on cost and risk: risk in schedule delays is not an issue because it is unlikely. 
% INSERT triangle FIGURE
\subsection{Functional requirements}
The functional requirements [relative weight] are: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item TVC angle excursion [13.0\%]: a higher angle is preferable to obtain a larger controllability window for rocket attitude dynamics
 \item Aerodynamic drag [4.0\%]:  a low aerodynamics effect is important to reduce stresses and losses
 \item Sustainer thrust fraction [4.6\%]:  a higher fraction would guarantee a minor sensibility to boosting phase imbalance, however losses due to parallel configuration are increased
 \item Boosters thrust fraction [10.1\%]:  a higher fraction would cause a major sensibility to boosting phase imbalance, but it would grant a smaller system due to a lower propellant volume
 \item Centre of mass excursion [5.1\%]
 \item Misalignment of thrust with respect to centre of mass [9.8\%]: the boosting phase unbalance generates an arm for the vertical component of thrust, that causes an undesired moment
 \item Velocity at boosters’ detachment [7.8\%]
 \item Altitude at boosters’ detachment [9.1\%]
 \item Sensors responding time [13.7\%]
 \item Attitude angular position sensitivity [10.1\%]
 \item Attitude angular velocity sensitivity [10.1\%]    
 \item GPS/Radar visibility [2.6\%]: important parameter to keep track of the rocket during its flight trajectory 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Competitive analysis}
Two main competitors to Ariane V ECA are considered:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item \textbf{SpaceX} – \textit{Falcon Heavy}
 \item \textbf{Nasa} – \textit{Delta IV Heavy}
\end{enumerate}
As shown in Fig (), the strongest competitor is the \textbf{SpaceX} - \textit{Falcon Heavy} which assure higher performances in most of the customer requirements.
However, \textit{Falcon Heavy} has never flown in a real mission and because of this its data are just theoretical.
The \textit{Delta IV Heavy} has accomplished many missions, but it has lower performances in all the meaningful mission parameters exception made for the lightweight system parameter.

\subsection{Baseline}
Ariane V ECA in the nominal condition is the baseline to this study. The nominal system is composed by a parallel first stage with a liquid cryogenic couple (LH2-LOX) main engine and two solid rocket boosters that provide almost 90\% of the total thrust at lift-off. There is also a cryogenic upper stage, but it is of no interest for this project.

\chapter{Aerodynamics}
In this chapter it will be analysed the Ariane 5 ECA rocket aerodynamics. Aerodynamics is a very complex aspect to model during a design phase, and the behaviour of the flow around a rocket is very complicated and difficult to foresee. In this case the configuration of a parallel rocket complicates more the study. The model of the rocket has been created with SolidWorks\textsuperscript\textregistered using the real dimensions and masses [Figure **]. The main aspect that are analysed are the drag coefficient, the normal force coefficient (useful for the thrust vector control) and the position of the centre of pressure (useful for the thrust vector control). 
%INSERT IMAGE
\section{Drag coefficient}
First it is evaluated the drag coefficient of the rocket. From our baseline is possible to obtain the real profile of drag coefficient in function of the Mach number. Extrapolating the data from [*], the real profile has been obtained, as can be seen in Figure **. From the data a function has been created, using the interpolation function of Matlab\textsuperscript\textregistered: in this way it is possible to have an approximated drag coefficient for each Mach number. In general, the drag coefficient contains different contributions, such as wave drag, skin friction, base drag, parasitic drag, … 
%INSERT IMAGE
\section{Normal force coefficient}
The normal force coefficient is an important parameter, especially for the evaluation of the normal force effect on an aerodynamic model. It must be evaluated since it will be important; moreover, its derivative with respect to the angle of attack is important for the study of the cross-wind effect and the thrust vector control. From the model described previously, it can be noticed that the cross-section changes along the rocket. To obtain a result in a simple way, consider the coefficient of the two sections separately, and then we make a weighted average with the lengths. The empirical relation adopted is the following: 
\begin{equation}
 |C_N|=\Biggl[\frac{a}{b}cos^2\phi+\frac{b}{a}sin^2\phi\Biggr]\Biggl[\biggl|sin(2\alpha)cos\biggl(\frac{\alpha}{2}\biggr)\biggr|+1.3\frac{l}{d}sin^2\alpha\Biggr]
\end{equation}
Since the cross section of the rocket changes, a simple approached is to consider the contribution to the coefficient of the upper part with a circular cross section (axisymmetric body), and the lower one with an elliptical cross section (lifting body). Then a weighted averaged will give the final value, weighting on the lengths. The problem is that the empirical relation is valid for a fineness ratio greater than 5, and the respective values for the two parts are both less than 5. So, a single body is considered with the length of the rocket and the elliptical section of the lower part. All the fineness ratios are reported in Table **.

\begin{adjustbox}{max width=\textwidth}
\begin{tabular}{lr}
\toprule
			&$\frac{l}{d}$\\
\midrule                                                                                                             
Upper part		&$3.7963$\\                                                 
Lower part	        &$3.8069$\\
Overall body		&$6.4083$\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular} 
\end{adjustbox}
\label{tab:baseline}
\end{center}

It is worth remembering that the aerodynamic coefficients must be referred to the same reference area. As a result, the relation becomes: 
\begin{equation}
 |C_N|=\Biggl[\frac{a}{b}cos^2\phi+\frac{b}{a}sin^2\phi\Biggr]\Biggl[\biggl|sin(2\alpha)cos\biggl(\frac{\alpha}{2}\biggr)\biggr|+1.3\frac{l_B}{\sqrt{ab}}sin^2\alpha\Biggr]
\end{equation}
The behaviour is shown in Figure **. 
%INSERTI IMAGE
At this point is important to derive the derivative of the normal force coefficient, since it will be useful next:
\begin{equation}
 C_{N/\alpha}=\frac{\partial}{\partial\alpha}C_N(\alpha,\phi)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 C_{N/\alpha}=\Biggl[\frac{a}{b}cos^2\phi+\frac{b}{a}sin^2\phi\Biggr]\Biggl[\Biggl|2cos(2\alpha)cos\biggl(\frac{\alpha}{2}\biggr)-\frac{1}{2}sin(2\alpha)sin\biggl(\frac{\alpha}{2}\biggr)\Biggr|+1.3\frac{l_B}{\sqrt{ab}}2sin\alpha\; cos\alpha\Biggr]
\end{equation}
Its behaviour is shown in Figure **.

\section{Centre of pressure}
For the evaluation of the position of the centre of pressure it is adopted the slender body theory result:
\begin{equation}
 \frac{x_{CP}}{d}=\underbrace{\frac{2hS}{3dS_b}}_{\text{1}}+\underbrace{\Biggl(1-\frac{S}{S_b}\Biggr)\frac{l_B}{d}}_{\text{2}}-\underbrace{\frac{h_f}{d}\Biggl(\frac{d^2_m}{d^2}-1\Biggr)\frac{S}{S_b}}_{\text{3}}
\end{equation}
In this relation are considered the effects of the nose (1), body (2), and flare (3). To be more precise, but without complicating too much the problem, two values are considered: one related to the main body, and the other related to the boosters. Then a weighted averaged is executed based on the lengths of the two parts. Mathematically: 
\begin{equation}
 \frac{x^{mb}_{CP}}{d_{EPC}}=\frac{2}{3}\frac{l_N}{d_{EPC}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 \frac{x_{CP}^{EAP}}{d_{EAP}}=\frac{2}{3}\frac{l_{EAP}A_{EAP}}{d_{EAP}A_f}+\Biggl(1-\frac{A_{EAP}}{A_f}\Biggr)\frac{l_{EAP}}{d_{EAP}}-\frac{h_f}{d_{EAP}}\Biggl(\frac{d^2_m}{d^2_{EAP}}-1\Biggr)\frac{A_{EAP}}{A_f}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 x_{CP}=\frac{x_{CP}^{mb}(l_B-l_{EAP})+2x_{CP}^{EAP}l_B}{(l_B-l_{EAP})+2l_B}=\SI{19.2756}{m}
\end{equation}
It is made the assumption that the centre of pressure will remain always in that position from the nose of the Ariane. 


\chapter{Propulsion}
Since in this report the analysis is focused on the possible troubles given by an imbalance situation between the two external solid rocke boosters, only the first stage of the vehicle is considered. This is composed by the sustainer, called \textbf{EPC} which stands for \textbf{Étage Principal Cryotechnique} that burn parallely with two solid rocket boosters. They are referred to as \textbf{EAPs} from the French Title \textbf{Etage d’Acceleration à Poudre}. This propulsive analysis has two main targets. Firstly, a thrust profile of both \textbf{EAPs} and \textbf{EPC}, as near as possible to the real data, has to be obtained. Secondly, the propellant mass flow rate of the engines has to be computed in order to analyze in the next chapter the excursion of the centre of gravity due to the propellant consumption during the first stage burning time.\\
To reach these goals all the computations are made using the MATLAB\textsuperscript\textregistered software. 
\section{EPC-Étage Principal Cryotechnique}
The main core stage of the \textbf{Ariane 5 ECA} provides almost the \SI{8\%} of liftoff total thrust. Is powered by a \textit{Vulcain 2} engine which operates for about \SI{540}{s} burning a mixture of LH2/LOX (Liquid Hydrogen and Liquid Oxygen). Knowing the area expansion ratio, the combustion chamber pressure and the oxid to fuel ratio from the literature, using the CEA software from NASA it's possible to calculate
